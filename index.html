                                    Resume
                                </a></h1>
    <p>Hey there, my name is Todd Schindler and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from
        the University of Washington. I have focused heavily on AI, Vision, and Computer Graphics
        for my last year at University, and I am looking forward to applying some of my creative
        and technical skills in the field this year!
    </p>

<h1> My Inspirations: </h1>
    <p>
        I love video games, and I always have, I learned my left and rights from reading the Ocarina
        of Time guidebooks. Telling stories and constructing unique experiences has always been one
        of my favorite pass times and video games are my favorite medium to do it. I am in love with computer
        graphics and have become quite the linear algebra master. I want to be on the cutting edge of modern
        graphics and hope to go to graduate school for it one day. Currently very interested in non-euclidian
        level design in games.

        <h2>Cuidadores de Agua Video Game</h2>
        <p2 >
        In 2024 and 2025 I created a curriculum and taught a class to eight students for four months about video game development basics. We went over 
        coding, 3d modeling, and level design. At the end of the teaching portion of the program we tackled completing an educational game
        related to the EPA Superfund cleanup site in the Lower Duwamish River of Seattle. We cited EPA contacts and resources to create
        the educational aspects of the game. In the end we created an nine level long game based around the dredging of contaminated sediment
         in the river. You can find the project files here. And you can find a online version of the game here.

        <h2> Battler Arena </h2>
        <p2>
        A group of 5 other people and I recently decided to make a game in less than two months. The original
        Idea was a stick battle arena but we quickly realized that limited the vision of the project and switched
        it over to battler arena. You can <a href="https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release"> download the game here</a>. 
        If you have ever played Duck Game before its like that.
