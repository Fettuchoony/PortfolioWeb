<h1>Todd's Super Epic Website</h1>
<p>Hey there, my name is Todd Schindler and I am a Computer Science student graduating from
    the University of Washington in 2023. I have focused heavily on AI, Vision, and Computer Graphics
     for my last year at University, and I am looking forward to applying some of my creative
     and technical skills in the field this year!
