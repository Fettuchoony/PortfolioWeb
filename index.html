                                    Resume
                                </a></h1>
    <p>Hey there, my name is Todd Schindler and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from
        the University of Washington. I have focused heavily on AI, Vision, and Computer Graphics
        for my last year at University, and I am looking forward to applying some of my creative
        and technical skills in the field this year!
    </p>

<h1> My Inspirations: </h1>
    <p>
        I love video games, and I always have, I learned my left and rights from reading the Ocarina
        of Time guidebooks. Telling stories and constructing unique experiences has always been one
        of my favorite pass times and video games are my favorite medium to do it. I am in love with computer
        graphics and have become quite the linear algebra master. I want to be on the cutting edge of modern
        graphics and hope to go to graduate school for it one day. Currently very interested in non-euclidian
        level design in games.
    </p>

        <h2> Battler Arena </h2>
        <p2>
        A group of 5 other people and I recently decided to make a game in less than two months. The original
        Idea was a stick battle arena but we quickly realized that limited the vision of the project and switched
        it over to battler arena. You can <a href="https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release"> download the game here</a>. 
        If you have ever played Duck Game before its like that.

        <h2>VR Terrain Sculpting Tool</h2>
        <p2 >
        This is a project that is in progress, but it works. It is a terrain sculpting tool designed for game developers.
        VR is always being used by consumers for gaming, but what if it could be useful in the development process? My friend
        Alaina and I wondered this and set out to make a level editor in VR. Its pretty neat and you get to shoot lasers
        from your hands. You can find it <a href="https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release">here</a>.
