<h1> About Me:</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Todd Schindler and I am a Computer Science graduate from
        the University of Washington. During my time at UW I focused heavily on AI, Vision, and Computer Graphics
         and I am looking forward to applying some of my creative and technical skills in the field this year! 
         In 2024 and 2025 I worked at a non-profit community organization called the Duwamish Valley Sustainability Association (DVSA).
          At DVSA I was project manager of three different major projects. First was the installation and operation of the first community owned and operated biodigester
          , located at Foodlifeline. Concurrently, I directed about 16 students through an air quality monitoring course. After this I 
          created a curriculum for video game development and 3D modeling. I taught this curriculum immediately after and in about three 
          months the youth and I had created a basic 3D game. The game and the program are called Cuidadores de Agua, which roughly translates 
          to caretakers of the water in English. We worked with the EPA to integrate research from their superfund project in the Lower Duwamish River 
          into the content of our game.
    </p>

        Also, I was the primary grant writer, website manager, and final report writer at DVSA. I had to read/write both Spanish and
        English at the job and I studied Spanish for five years in school, so I have got pretty good at it.

<h1> My Inspirations: </h1>
    <p>
        I love video games, and I always have, I learned my left and rights from reading the Ocarina
        of Time guidebooks. Telling stories and constructing unique experiences has always been one
        of my favorite pass times and video games are my favorite medium to do it. I am in love with computer
        graphics and have become quite the linear algebra master. I want to be on the cutting edge of modern
        graphics and hope to go to graduate school for it one day. Currently very interested in non-euclidian
        level design in games.

        <h2>Cuidadores de Agua Video Game</h2>
        <p2 >
        In 2024 and 2025 I created a curriculum and taught a class to eight students for four months about video game development basics. We went over 
        coding, 3d modeling, and level design. At the end of the teaching portion of the program we tackled completing an educational game
        related to the EPA Superfund cleanup site in the Lower Duwamish River of Seattle. We cited EPA contacts and resources to create
        the educational aspects of the game. In the end we created an nine level long game based around the dredging of contaminated sediment
         in the river. You can find the project files here. And you can find a online version of the game here.

        <h2> Battler Arena </h2>
        <p2>
        A group of 5 other people and I recently decided to make a game in less than two months. The original
        Idea was a stick battle arena but we quickly realized that limited the vision of the project and switched
        it over to battler arena. You can <a href="https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release"> download the game here</a>. 
        If you have ever played Duck Game before its like that.

            <h2> Biking Across the United States </h2>
            <p2>
            In 2025 I set out from Seattle to Washington D.C alone on my bicycle with only basic camping gear. I crossed through Yellowstone,
            then went straight over to Chicago. From there I biked to the Great Allegheny Passage and rode the trail all the way to the Capitol.
            The experience required an insane amount of perseverance and I will never forget the friends I made along the way.

        <h2>VR Terrain Sculpting Tool</h2>
        <p2>
            This is a project that is in progress, but it works. It is a terrain sculpting tool designed for game developers.
            VR is always being used by consumers for gaming, but what if it could be useful in the development process? My friend
            Alaina and I wondered this and set out to make a level editor in VR. Its pretty neat and you get to shoot lasers
            from your hands. You can find it <a href="https://jimmyc.itch.io/cse403-stick-battle-arena-alpha-release">here</a>.
